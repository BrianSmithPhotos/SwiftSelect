/// VLM round-trip completes — see `SourceBrowserViewModel.suggestAI()`). `suggest()` runs
/// `SceneTriageService`'s free, on-device classification on whatever `image` it's given, but only to
/// pick the description word limit and the `sceneCategory` tag surfaced in the UI. The species-ID
/// instructions in `buildUserPrompt` are phrased conditionally ("if the subject is a bird...") and
/// sent on every request regardless of triage, because Vision's "bird" confidence on confirmed,
/// well-cropped birds has been observed ranging from 0.08 to 0.44 depending on head/pose visibility —
/// there's no threshold that reliably separates real birds from background scenes, so identification
/// accuracy isn't worth gating on it. Not part of SPEC.md/the Python reference app; added to improve
/// wildlife/plant identification accuracy (e.g. small VLMs conflating similar-looking species) beyond
/// what a single generic prompt gets.
/// Which prompt variant `AISuggestionService` builds. `.full` is the original prompt, written for
/// capable models (all Mac/OpenRouter models, and the Mac app always uses it). `.compact` is a
/// pared-down variant for small on-device models (e.g. FastVLM-0.5B) that otherwise misbehave on the
/// full prompt — they echo its JSON example's placeholder keywords verbatim and don't honor its
/// "if the subject is a bird…" conditional (bird-ID'ing non-wildlife). The iPad selects `.compact`
/// per-model; see `PhotoBrowserViewModel.compactPromptModels`.
///
/// `.guided` is for `FoundationModelsProvider`, whose `@Generable` schema *guarantees* a
/// well-formed `{description, keywords, species}` result — so it drops the "Return only strict JSON"
/// framing (which would make guided generation emit JSON text into a string field) and instead adds
/// a line telling the model to fill the typed `species` field. All the substantive
