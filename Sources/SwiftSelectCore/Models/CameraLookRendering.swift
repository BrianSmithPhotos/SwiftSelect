/// "Ideas, not started"), and the only one of the six groups that is *mutually exclusive*. That
/// exclusivity is what makes one large graphic viable instead of a stack of widgets.
///
/// Two display decisions live here rather than in the view, because both are judgements about the
/// data rather than about layout:
///
/// 1. **The three B&W routes are merged.** A monochrome filter and tint reach the screen by three
///    routes with three different numberings — the art filters' stacked `0x8060`/`0x8070` records,
///    the monochrome profiles' `MonochromeProfileSettings`/`MonochromeColor`, and the Monotone
///    picture mode's `PictureModeBWFilter`/`PictureModeTone`. `CameraLookParsing` must keep them
///    strictly apart (sharing a table would turn orange into red and purple into blue), but they
///    mean the same thing to the eye. The separation is a file-format concern, not a display one.
///
/// 2. **A stale reading loses to the live one.** The camera leaves values behind in tags the current
///    mode doesn't use — a Grainy Film frame carries `"Partial Color 0"`, and a non-zero
///    `ColorProfileSettings` can ride along on an art-filter frame the same way. So this picks by
///    priority rather than asserting only one field is ever populated.
