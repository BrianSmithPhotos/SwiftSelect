/// actually rendered with, for the look visualiser (docs/SPEC.md groups 3-6).
///
/// Every rule below was measured off real frames rather than assumed — `scripts/README.md` has the
/// numbers:
///
/// - The three tone dials compose by **adding their deviations** from the identity. Serial
///   composition loses badly on two of the three pairs (11.46 and 10.28 rms against additive's
///   3.84). Additive is itself wrong by up to 8 levels in the upper midtones, accepted deliberately
///   because it changes neither which way the curve bends nor where it pivots.
/// - Picture Mode contrast is a **separate serial stage, applied first** — 0.46 rms against
///   Highlight +7, comfortably independent.
/// - Gradation **overrides contrast entirely**: under High Key the contrast dial is the identity to
///   1.2 levels where the same change under Normal moves 20.2, *and the maker note still records the
///   value the camera ignored*. So a populated `contrast` is not evidence the camera applied it.
/// - One table serves every Picture Mode (Monochrome against Colour Profile agrees to 0.1 of a
///   level), and one grey curve serves all three channels (per-channel spread collapses to 3.04
///   once the rig's white balance is neutral).
///
/// How a Gradation preset combines with the tone dials was never measured, and does not need to be:
/// the two live in different Picture Modes — Gradation in the standard ones, the tone dials in the
/// Colour and Monochrome Profiles — so no frame carries both. Checked, not assumed: across the 154
/// distinct maker-note signatures in `CameraLookFixture.json`, 29 move a tone dial and 3 set a
/// non-Normal Gradation, and none do both. The code composes them serially anyway rather than
/// carrying a special case for a combination it would then have to decide how to reject.
