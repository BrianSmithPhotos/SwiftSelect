# SwiftSelect (Swift)

A from-scratch Swift/SwiftUI reimplementation of [phototags](https://github.com/BrianSmithPhotos/phototags)
(a Python/PySide6 app), taken on as a way to learn both Swift and SwiftUI. Not a port — see
`docs/SPEC.md` for the product spec this is building toward, and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for how
code should be organized. Both are self-contained; you don't need the Python sibling repo to work
in this one.

Two more that are worth knowing exist:

- [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) — the helper scripts, and the measurement programme
  behind the camera-look visualiser: what was shot, what came back, which runs were void and why.
  Every number the visualiser draws traces to a section in there.
- [`docs/MLX_PROVIDER.md`](docs/MLX_PROVIDER.md) — the native in-process MLX backend, its model
  allowlist, and the decision record for why it exists alongside Ollama.

## Requirements

- macOS 14+
- Xcode (recommended, for SwiftUI Previews) or the Swift toolchain via Xcode Command Line Tools
  (`xcode-select --install`) if working from another editor.
- [`exiftool`](https://exiftool.org/) on `PATH` (`brew install exiftool`) — all metadata read/write
  goes through it, same as the Python sibling app.
- Optional, for AI-assisted suggestions: a running [Ollama](https://ollama.com) server with a
  vision-capable model, and/or an [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) API key (see
  `docs/SPEC.md` §6). A third, native in-process MLX backend (`mlx-swift-lm`, no server/API key
  needed) is also available — see `docs/MLX_PROVIDER.md`. If a model is already downloaded via
  [oMLX](https://github.com/BrianSmithPhotos/omlx)'s model manager (its downloader is the more
  robust of the two), `MLXModelRegistry` picks it up straight from oMLX's local store instead of
  re-downloading multi-GB weights a second time — see `docs/MLX_PROVIDER.md` "Sharing downloads
  with oMLX".
- Optional, for eBird-verified bird-species candidate lists in AI prompts: an
  [eBird](https://ebird.org) API key.
- Optional, for Develop RAW on a camera Apple's newest RAW decoder doesn't list (e.g. OM System
  bodies today): [Adobe DNG Converter](https://helpx.adobe.com/camera-raw/using/adobe-dng-converter.html).
  Without it those files develop at the newest decoder they themselves offer — see `docs/SPEC.md` §5
  "RAW develop".
- Both API keys are entered in Settings (Cmd+,) > API Keys, where they're stored in the macOS
  Keychain via `APIKeyStore` — this is the reliable path for GUI-launched builds (Xcode's Run
  button, Finder, Dock), none of which inherit a shell's `.zshrc` exports. Setting the process
  environment variable directly (`EBIRD_API_KEY` / `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) still works and takes
  precedence over the Keychain, which is convenient for `swift run`/terminal debugging.

## Getting started

Open `Package.swift` directly in Xcode, or from the command line:

```sh
swift build
swift run
swift test
```

`swift run` launches the app as a plain process — no custom icon/Dock identity, and a fresh ad-hoc
code-signing identity on every rebuild, so macOS privacy grants (e.g. Files and Folders access to a
Google Drive folder for Timeline sync) tied to that signature can need re-granting. Fine for
day-to-day development.

For a real, Dock-pinnable app, run `scripts/build-app-bundle.sh` — see `scripts/README.md`
"build-app-bundle.sh" — which builds `dist/SwiftSelect.app` (ad-hoc signed, not notarized/
Developer ID, so it's for running on this machine, not distributing to others). It builds via
`xcodebuild` rather than `swift build -c release`: mlx-swift-lm's Metal shaders only get compiled
into `default.metallib` by Xcode's build system, so a plain SwiftPM release build ships without it
and the app silently aborts (no crash report) on first MLX use.

The same binary also runs headless, for the one job too large to click through —
writing SwiftPhotoLog's model-written captions into the photographs themselves:

```sh
swift run SwiftSelect writeback --manifest ~/photo-index/writeback.jsonl \
    --log ~/photo-index --quiet "17:00-21:30" --dry-run
```

It resumes from its own done log, and that log is what SwiftPhotoLog's `rekey`
reads afterwards — the write changes each file's hash. See docs/SPEC.md §3.

## Status

Past the skeleton stage — the core ingest workflow from `docs/SPEC.md` works end to end:

- **Source browsing** (§1): folder navigation, capture-set grouping, a Stacked thumbnail grid,
  capture-group-aware multi-select, and a preview filmstrip with ring-selection. Grouping is one set
  per press of the shutter — a burst, a bracket, an in-camera composite or a whole interval/timelapse
  run counts as one press — decided by the camera's own maker-note counters read in a narrow batched
  `exiftool` pass, because the OM-3's whole-second timestamps make gaps within one capture and gaps
  between two captures overlap completely. Any group of sets can also be merged by hand (and split
  apart again), persisted per folder, for captures the camera left no counter behind for. iPad has no
  maker-note access at all and falls back to the timestamp gap. Skip/un-skip is recorded per file —
  an individual frame can be culled from a bracket in the filmstrip — persisted per folder, with an
  Active/Skipped segmented filter to review and restore skipped items.
- **Metadata read/write** (§2–3): full EXIF/IPTC/XMP read and dual-tag write via `ExifToolClient`,
  batched across files, idempotent keyword writes, and save scopes for a single file, a capture
  set, or the current manual selection.
- **Rename** (§4): deterministic destination filenames, including the in-camera art-filter token
  parsed from maker notes.
- **Process & move** (§5): verified copy (size + SHA-256) to a library folder routed by file type,
  with a persisted, non-blocking "processed" checkmark badge on the source grid and preview
  filmstrip (`ProcessedStateStore`) so a re-opened folder still shows what's already gone through
  once — it never prevents reprocessing. Auto-skipping successfully processed files (per
  `docs/SPEC.md` §5) isn't wired yet.
- **Videos** (§9): clips on the card (`.MOV`, `.MP4`) browse in the same grid — poster-frame tile
  with a play/duration badge, a real player in the preview pane, the same Skip — and Process & Move
  copies them, verified and under the camera's own filename, to `~/videotmp/<batch>/` rather than
  into the library. No metadata, and never sent to an AI provider. On iPad they are staged inside
  the Process package under a batch-named folder for the Mac's import to move across.
- **RAW develop** (§5): right-click a capture set or a RAW in the filmstrip → Develop RAW renders a
  JPEG variant with Apple's RAW engine and joins it to the capture set. Decoder chosen per file: the
  newest one the file itself reaches, or via a temporary DNG for a camera that decoder doesn't list
  (Adobe DNG Converter, optional). The derivative stages in Application Support — never on the SD
  card — and carries a decoder-honest `RAW9`/`RAW8` token into its filename and keywords. On iPad,
  which can't write a DNG, the action instead marks the file for the Mac's import to develop.
- **AI-assisted suggestions** (§6): pluggable provider interface with three backends — local
  Ollama, cloud OpenRouter, and a native in-process MLX backend (`mlx-swift-lm`, see
  `docs/MLX_PROVIDER.md`) — vision pre-check, retry-with-crop fallback, and group-aware
  description/keyword application. Wildlife/plant identification is improved beyond the base spec
  via a "Crop to Subject" toggle (crops to `SubjectIsolationService`'s Vision-detected subject
  before sending, or a user-drawn rectangle on the preview overriding it — see the toggle's doc
  comment on `SourceBrowserViewModel.subjectIsolationEnabled`), and via an eBird region-species
  candidate list (see `EBirdCandidateFormatting`) that verified-locally-recorded
  species are drawn from instead of free model recall — gated off by default for a few
  flagship/pay-per-token OpenRouter models to control input-token cost (per-model toggle in
  Settings, Cmd+,), always on for the local Ollama/MLX backends.
- **GPS enrichment from Google Timeline** (§7): Drive-synced `Timeline.json` imported idempotently
  into a local GRDB/SQLite cache, nearest-timestamp matching within a bounded window, ground-truth
  elevation lookup (never trusting Timeline altitude), and reverse geocoding for location keywords
  and AI prompt context. Sync runs on launch, on folder navigation, and via a manual "Refresh
  Timeline" button in Settings (Cmd+,).
- **Camera-look visualiser** (⌘L, off by default): a translucent strip over the preview drawing the
  in-camera creative settings — one hero graphic for the colour rendering (Colour Profile disc,
  Colour Creator wheel, Partial Color band, or monochrome), the composite tone curve with the
  dialled values on hover, and the sliders and finish rows below. A RAW shows "Neutral rendered RAW"
  instead, since the ORF carries the maker-note bytes but was never developed through them. The
  ring positions, the Partial Color bands and all 30 tone curves are **measured off real frames**
  rather than guessed — the shot lists, the tooling, the results and the wrong turns are written up
  in [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md), which is the reference for anything that changes the
  numbers behind these graphics.
- A native, read-only `NativeMetadataReader` (ImageIO-based) exists alongside `ExifToolClient` as a
  faster-path prototype for reads/previews — see its header doc for scope.
- The Metadata pane is a `.inspector()` (not a third `NavigationSplitView` column), giving it the
  same translucent sidebar material as the Source pane plus a native collapse toggle in the toolbar.
- `scripts/build-app-bundle.sh` packages a real, ad-hoc-signed `SwiftSelect.app` (custom icon,
  stable identity across rebuilds, built via `xcodebuild` so mlx-swift-lm's Metal shaders compile
  correctly) that can be pinned to the Dock — not a substitute for `swift run` during day-to-day
  development, just the way to get a Dock-launchable build.
- API keys (eBird, OpenRouter) resolve from the process environment first, then fall back to the
  macOS Keychain via `APIKeyStore`, with a Settings (Cmd+,) > API Keys section to store them —
  fixes GUI-launched builds (Xcode Run button, Finder, Dock) never seeing shell-exported env vars.

Not yet built: a notarized/Developer ID-signed `.app` for distributing beyond this machine, and the
deferred items noted in `CLAUDE.md` (ImageIO metadata write-back).

**iPadOS target**: `Package.swift` builds a portable `SwiftSelectCore` library (all Services/Models
except `ExifToolClient`, which needs `Process`/subprocess execution unavailable on iOS) plus the
`SwiftSelect` macOS app. The iPadOS app lives outside the manifest, in its own Xcode project at
`SwiftSelectPad/SwiftSelectPad.xcodeproj` (generated via `xcodegen` from `project.yml` in that
directory), which depends on `SwiftSelectCore` as a local Swift package — a bare SwiftPM
`executableTarget` can't produce a real, device-signable `.app` bundle for iOS, so it needed a genuine
Xcode App target instead. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` "Multi-platform target split" for the rationale
and the access-control/API-availability gotchas hit along the way. Confirmed installing and launching
on a physical iPad.

The iPad ingest workflow (source browse through process/move) is built and user-verified end to end:
two-panel `NavigationSplitView` (source browser + preview/filmstrip), editable metadata form (Save
scopes: this file / capture set / current selection), a live rename preview driven by a per-session
"Batch" label, and Process & Move (four scope buttons: single image / capture set / current
selection / session), with a persisted "processed" checkmark badge mirroring the Mac app's. Metadata
edits are staged via `SidecarStagingStore` (never written straight to the source, which may be a
read-only or actively-in-use camera card) and folded in at Process & Move time. `NativeMetadataWriter`
(ImageIO `.xmp` sidecar) is the write path throughout, since `exiftool` can't run on iOS. Process &
Move's destination is a fixed local folder inside the app's own sandbox (`Documents/ProcessedLibrary`)
rather than a user-picked one — a Google-Drive-mounted folder was considered and ruled out (Drive's
background sync could race with `ProcessMoveService`'s own copy+verify), and the eventual off-device
transfer is planned as a separate, not-yet-designed Mac-initiated pull rather than an iPad-side push.
See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` "iPad file access & sidecar staging" for the full reasoning.

`Timeline.json` GPS suggestion (step 6) and reverse geocoding (step 7) are also built and
user-verified: a Settings sheet locates `Timeline.json` in the Google Drive Files provider once
(persisted as a security-scoped bookmark and re-imported silently on later launches), GPS-less photos
get a location and altitude suggested from the nearest Timeline point — read-only on iPad, but
persisted through Save and Process & Move — and once a photo has GPS, city/county/state are merged
into the keyword field via OpenStreetMap Nominatim. AI-assisted suggestions (step 8, first cut) are
also built and user-verified: a Suggest button in the metadata sheet with two providers — native
on-device MLX (`mlx:`, e.g. FastVLM-0.5B, which runs in seconds on the M4 iPad) and OpenRouter
(`openrouter:`, key entered in Settings); Ollama is excluded (no daemon on iPad). Getting on-device
MLX to run took iOS-specific Metal/memory setup — see `docs/MLX_PROVIDER.md` "On-device (iPad)".
Step 8b (pass 1) added a `.compact` prompt profile for small on-device models (drops the copyable JSON
keyword example, gates species-ID on scene-triage — selected per-model in Settings), registered
`gemma-3-4b-it-4bit` as the recommended/default on-device model (good keywords + descriptions in
seconds, ~5.3GB peak), and added a cheap user-verified OpenRouter preset. Pass 2 wired in the eBird
candidate list (common-names-only prompt) with a deterministic local binomial lookup — the model names
the bird by common name, the app attaches the correct Latin name from the eBird taxonomy (whole-word
matched against the description + the user's trusted keywords only, never the model's own keywords, to
avoid certifying a hallucinated species). Still deferred (last 8b item): subject isolation.

## Next stages

- **MLX preset list pruning**: `AIModelSelection.presets`'s `mlx:` entries grew during exploratory
  accuracy testing (see `docs/MLX_PROVIDER.md`); expect to trim to whichever models actually proved
  worth keeping once testing settles.
- **Auto-skip-on-process** (`docs/SPEC.md` §5's "successfully processed files auto-skip from the
  current session view") is intentionally not wired up — the user prefers processed files staying
  visible for now; revisit only if asked.
- **iPadOS app**: source browse through process/move, `Timeline.json` GPS suggestion, reverse
  geocoding, and AI-assisted suggestions (MLX + OpenRouter, small-model prompt profile, eBird
  candidate list + local binomial lookup) — steps 1-8 plus 8b passes 1-2 — are shipped and
  user-verified on the physical iPad (see "Status" above). The Apple Foundation Models
  (`foundation:`) provider listed here as a future possibility shipped 2026-07-24 and is in the
  shared preset list, so it is available on both platforms — see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` "Provider
  pattern (AI)" for the `@Generable` guided-generation shape and the macOS/iOS 27 SDK build
  constraint. Remaining: **subject isolation** (the last 8b item), and a not-yet-designed
  Mac-initiated pull to move processed files off the iPad.
