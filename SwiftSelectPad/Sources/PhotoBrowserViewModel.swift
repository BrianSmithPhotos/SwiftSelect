/// iPad-scoped counterpart to the macOS app's `SourceBrowserViewModel` — still a smaller slice while

/// GPS/geocoding have since landed. Wires up browsing, capture-set grouping, skip/un-skip,
/// single-selection preview,
/// grid multi-select, description/keywords metadata editing + save (staged via
/// `SidecarStagingStore`, not written straight to the original file — see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's
/// iPad section), a live rename preview (`titlePreview`), and Process & Move (`process(scope:)`),
/// all via the platform-portable `SwiftSelectCore` services the macOS view model already uses for
/// the same jobs — `ProcessMoveService` is constructed with `NativeMetadataWriter()` here instead of
/// the Mac app's `ExifToolClient()`, but is otherwise reused unmodified. Renaming itself, like the
/// Mac app, only ever applies to the destination copy made at Process & Move time — this view model
/// only computes the *preview*, never renames the source file.
///
/// Multi-select mirrors the Mac app's `multiSelectedIDs`/shift-click behavior two ways: touch has
/// no modifier-key equivalent, so "Select mode" plus tap-to-toggle stands in for cmd-click there;
/// but when a hardware keyboard/trackpad is attached, real cmd-click/shift-click also works
/// (`handleModifierClick`, via `TileTapCatcher`), reusing
/// the exact same portable `SelectionScope.rangeBetween` the Mac app's `selectTile(_:modifiers:)`
/// uses. Both paths write to the same `multiSelectedIDs`, which now doubles as the scope for
/// `saveMetadata(scope: .manualSelection(...))` the same way it already did for
/// `performBatchSkipAction`. This stops short of porting the Mac's filmstrip ring-selection, though:
/// that only exists to further narrow a Save/Process scope beyond the grid's own multi-selection —
/// see `PreviewPanelView`'s doc comment.
