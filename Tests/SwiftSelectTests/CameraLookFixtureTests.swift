/// A frozen baseline over the whole measured OM-3 corpus: one frame per distinct maker-note
/// signature, with the `look` and `token` strings the parsers produced when the fixture was
/// recorded.
///
/// `CameraLookParsingTests` covers each rule in isolation with hand-written metadata. This covers
/// the combinations instead — real cameras stack settings in ways a hand-written fixture never
/// thinks to, and every string here came off an actual file rather than being reasoned out. It
/// exists so a behaviour-preserving refactor (splitting `look(from:)` into a `CameraLook` value
/// type, so the visualiser has typed values to render) is provable rather than eyeballed.
///
/// The metadata is exactly what `exiftool -j -G1 -a -s` returned, matching
/// `ExifToolClient.readArguments` — PrintConv text, no `-n`, so the maker-note arrays carry the
/// camera's slider min/max padding.
///
/// A failure here means the rendered strings moved. That is a real result, not a stale fixture:
/// re-record only when the new output is deliberate and has been read line by line. To re-record,
/// point `MPM_RECORD_CAMERA_LOOK_FIXTURE` at the source file and diff before committing:
///
///     MPM_RECORD_CAMERA_LOOK_FIXTURE=Tests/SwiftSelectTests/Fixtures/CameraLookFixture.json \
///         swift test --filter CameraLookFixtureTests
///
/// Provenance: OM-3, frames H1071741-H1071932, shot 2026-08-07 to 2026-08-09 to exercise the art
/// filters, the colour and monochrome profiles, the Partial Color and Colour Creator rings, and the
/// plain picture modes. The frame names are kept only so a row can be traced back to the card.
